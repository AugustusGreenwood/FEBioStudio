              FEBIO STUDIO - RELEASE NOTES

*****************************************************************

===========================================================================

 R E L E A S E   1.1   11/2/2020
 
===========================================================================

* The FEBio 3.0 format is now the default format used when running FEBio models from within FEBio Studio. (Users can still select other formats.)
* Support was added for reading tied-facet-to-facet contact in febio2 files. 
* Abaqus export feature was added. This feature currently only supports writing the model as a single part, and only outputs nodes and elements. It only exports linear and quadratic solid elements. 
* A bug was fixed in febio3 file reader when MeshDomains section is empty. 
* Fixed an issue when using FEBioStudio on multiple monitors that have different dpi settings.
* A bug was fixed when a user tries to assign a mesh selection from another mesh that the model component was already assigned to. 
* A bug was fixed when rendering color gradients on discrete elements. 
* An issue was fixed when reloading plot files while graphs were open. This led sometimes to FEBio Studio crashing. 
* Several issues with visualizing 3D image data in post mode were fixed. 
* A context menu option was added to the model tree to allow the user to delete all discrete elements. 
* For colormaps and tensor plots the min/max range options can be set independently. 
* A couple bugs were fixed related to importing and exporting rigid constraints to febio3 format. 
* Support for xplt format 3 was added, which writes rigid bodies and rigid constraints to plot file. 
* An option was added to set a limit to the path length of a particle flow plot. 
* The PRLig material was moved to the "elastic" category (it was incorrectly listed under the "uncoupled elastic" category). 
* The Scalar Field tool can now be used to generate element data, which can then be assigned to a material parameter. 
* The selection box now supports collapsed view, which is the default for mesh item lists.
* A feature was added to grow and shrink selections. Use menu "Edit\More Selection Options\Grow (Shrink) Selection", or the corresponding shortcut keys. 
* An issue with the layout spacing of the description on the repo panel was fixed. 
* An option was added to the Abaqus importer to ignore the solid sections. 
* A few feature was added that allows a part selection to be converted to the corresponding element selection. 
* The febio3 exporter now writes named element selections. 
* Local repo file structure will now mimic file structure on repo panel. 
* A bug was fixed that was causing a segmentation fault when users tried to edit vec2i parameters. 
* Some issues were fixed reading MeshData section from febio 2.5 and 3.0 files.
* Added support for the "smooth_aug" parameter to the sliding-biphasic contact.
* Some issues were fixed with "target" rigid forces. 
* The "show material fiber" options is now stored in settings file. 
* The option to show fibers on hidden parts was expanded to include hidden elements. 
* Default material fiber orientation was changed to be consistent with FEBio. 
* The model tree now shows the type string next to each item. 
* An issue was fixed with processing mesh edges that was causing slow performance for models with a large number of edges. 
* The timeline panel was added which shows a time line of the states in the post model. 
* Support was added fir defining load curves for contact parameters (fixes issue #14). 
* A fix was added when reading febio2 files that converts the old "theta" and "phi" parameters of some fiber materials to the new format. 
* New materials were added: reactive plasticity, reactive plastic damage, DC octahedral shear streain. 
* Ported the old PostView save options to FEBio Studio. 
* Users can now set displacement scale factor for x,y,z independently. 
* The scale filter applied to vector fields now allows users to set the scale factor for x,y,z independently. 

===========================================================================

 R E L E A S E   1.0.3   10/7/2020
 
===========================================================================

* A bug was fixed that was causing some material parameters in a solid mixture (and other nested materials) to be reset when making edits in the material properties list.

===========================================================================

 R E L E A S E   1.0.2   10/2/2020
 
===========================================================================

* A bug was fixed that was preventing febio 2.5 files that contained mesh data "generators" from being read in. These sections are still ignored, but will not prevent the rest of the file from being read in. 
* A bug was fixed in reading prescribed bcs of the febio 3.0 file format. 
* A bug was fixed in the project tree of the repo panel and upload wizard related to how the folders are organized.


===========================================================================

 R E L E A S E   1.0.1   9/1/2020
 
===========================================================================

* This patch release fixes an issue with the default FEBio launch configuration on Windows. 

===========================================================================

 R E L E A S E   1.0.0   8/24/2020
 
===========================================================================

* This is the first official release of FEBio Studio. FEBio Studio integrates PreView, the FEBio pre-processor, and PostView, the FEBio post-processor, in a single unified software package.
* FEBio Studio can also run FEBio models directly from the UI and will always ship with the most recent
 R E L E A S E   of FEBio. This first release uses FEBio 3.0.
