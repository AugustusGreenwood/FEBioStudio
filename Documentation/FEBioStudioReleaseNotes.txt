 R E L E A S E   1.3   2/5/2021
 
===========================================================================

* A new auto-update feature was added that will inform users when a new version of FEBio/FEBioStudio is available. This feature can also be used to update the software automatically. 
* FEB files can now be opened as text files in FEBio Studio. When opening the feb file, the user can now choose to import the file as model, or as a text file. 
* FEB files opened as text files can be run directly in FEBio. 
* An improved transparency algorithm was implemented. This algorithm can be computationally more expensive, and if necessary, can be turned off in the Options dialog (Display, Improved transparency).
* The Welcome screen now separates recent model files and recent project (*.fsp) files. 
* Dolly (shift+right mouse button) and pan (ctrl + right mouse button) camera movements are fixed. 
* A bug was fixed with selecting the graphics widgets when multiple plot files are open. 
* Loadcurve can now be assigned to the rigid wall's offset parameter. 
* An issue was fixed that was causing a crash when reading body loads from febio3 format.
* Rigid body names can now be shown as labels in the Graphics View (to turn on, go to Options, Physics, show rigid labels). 
* A bug was fixed with selecting backfacing shell elements. 
* Added option to toggle rendering rigid body glyphs in Graphics View when viewing plot file. 
* Added a "probe" feature for inspecting values of points inside the mesh of a plot file. The value of the probes can be shown in a Graph Window.

* A bug was fixed that was preventing prescribed shell displacements being read in correctly from feb files. 
* A color map option was added to the Mesh Inspector. 
* A bug was fixed that was exporting incorrect values for mat3d variables from the Post\Data panel.

* The plane cut will now also show the mesh data when the Mesh Inspector is active. 
* Normals of the surface can now be shown in post view (i.e. when viewing plot files).

* The value parameters of prescribed displacement and initial pressure can now be defined as mapped parameters. 
* Fixed a bug with showing the rubber band box in ortho mode.
* Shortcuts were added for the standard views (Numpad 1 - 9). 
* A bug was fixed that caused project files downloaded from the model repository to be stored in the wrong location. 
* Set default locale on Linux to fix issues with feb files not reading and writing properly with system languages other than English. 
* Fixed support for the "from" attribute when reading feb files.

 R E L E A S E   1.2   11/23/2020
 
===========================================================================

* Warnings are now reported when invalid surface facets are detected while reading FEBio input file.
* Fixed crash when multiphasic material with solute/sbm is created before solutes/sbm are defined. 
* Modified STL reader so format is detected automatically. Users no longer need to specify whether the file is in ascii or binary format. 
* A bug was fixed in the Decimation tool.

* Several issues were fixed related to working on multiple models simultaneously. 
* An issue was fixed with rendering edges that have no nodes. 
* When reading feb files, the names of loads are retained. 
* Added density and k (bulk modulus) parameter to uncoupled prestrain material. This was preventing this material from being read in properly. 
* A bug was fixed with processing fiber property in feb files. 
* Fixed issues with rendering shells as hexes. 
* A bug was fixed that was not initializing edges correctly when reading the fsm files. 
* An issue was fixed with region-selecting nodes and faces when "select backfacing" and "ignore interior" options were set. 
* The algorithm parameters behind the "Scalar field" and "Fiber generator" tools can now be set. 
* In the Fiber generator tool, you can now specify for which material you want to apply the tool to.
* An issue was fixed with fsm files not closing properly after they are loaded. 
* A few issues were fixed with the Transform tool, when all transorm properties were set simultaneously. 
* A minor bug was fixed in the project upload wizard on the repo panel. 
* The prestrain constraint class is now available from the Constraints menu.

* Support was added for reading tied-facet-to-facet contact in febio2 files. 
* Abaqus export feature was added. This feature currently only supports writing the model as a single part, and only outputs nodes and elements. It only exports linear and quadratic solid elements. 
* A bug was fixed in febio3 file reader when MeshDomains section is empty. 
* Fixed an issue when using FEBioStudio on multiple monitors that have different dpi settings.
* A bug was fixed when a user tries to assign a mesh selection from another mesh that the model component was already assigned to.

* An option was added to set a limit to the path length of a particle flow plot. 
* The PRLig material was moved to the "elastic" category (it was incorrectly listed under the "uncoupled elastic" category). 
* The Scalar Field tool can now be used to generate element data, which can then be assigned to a material parameter. 
* The selection box now supports collapsed view, which is the default for mesh item lists.
* A feature was added to grow and shrink selections. Use menu "Edit\More Selection Options\Grow (Shrink) Selection", or the corresponding shortcut keys.

===========================================================================

 R E L E A S E   1.0.2   10/2/2020
 
===========================================================================

* A bug was fixed that was preventing febio 2.5 files that contained mesh data "generators" from being read in. These sections are still ignored, but will not prevent the rest of the file from being read in. 
* A bug was fixed in reading prescribed bcs of the febio 3.0 file format. 
* A bug was fixed in the project tree of the repo panel and upload wizard related to how the folders are organized.
