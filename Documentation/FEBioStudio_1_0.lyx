 surface and body loads, contact interfaces, analysis types, and more.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
FE model can be exported to FEBio and NIKE3D file formats.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mesh can also be exported to various file formats, including LSDYNA, VTK,
 and more.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBioStudio has been designed to create FEBio input files.
 Although it can create input files for other FE programs (like NIKE3D),
 this document assumes that FEBio will be used as the finite element solver.
 It is important to keep this in mind, since other programs may not support
 all the features of FEBio.

Step 3: Navigating the Graphics View
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this step we will show you the most important skills you need to navigate
 the Graphics View, namely rotating the view, zooming, panning, and selecting
 and transforming objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To rotate the view, click anywhere in an open area of the graphics view
 with the left mouse button and hold it down.
 By dragging the mouse left and right you can rotate the view to the left
 or to the right.
 Similarly, by dragging the mouse up and down you rotate the model up and
 down.
 Panning works similarly as rotating, except you use the middle mouse button
 instead of the left.
 Hold down the middle mouse button and drag the mouse to pan the view.
 You can zoom in or out by holding down the right mouse button.
 Drag the mouse up to zoom in and move it down to zoom out.
 See section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsubsec:navigating"

\end_inset

 for an overview of the different methods of changing the view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Step 4: Selecting objects
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsubsec:mylabel4"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Selection is another important aspect for interacting with the model.
 Selection requires a selection context, which tells FEBioStudio what type
 of entity you would like to select.
 The current selection context is highlighted on the toolbar and can be
 changed by clicking on the corresponding selection button.
 For instance, to select an object, first click the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Select Object
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button on the main toolbar (i.e.
 the button with the green ball).
 With the button selected, you can now select any object in the model by
 clicking on it with the left mouse button.
 Selecting another object will automatically unselect the first selected
 object.
 To add an object to the current selection, hold down the 
\emph on
shift
\emph default
 
\emph on
key
\emph default
 when you select the object.
 Similarly, you can remove an object from the current selection by holding
 down the 
\emph on
ctrl key 
\emph default
when clicking on the object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To select several objects with one motion, first choose a selection method
 from the main toolbar.
 There are three selection methods: rectangle, circle, and free form.
 For example, select the rectangle selection method.
 Now, hold down the 
\emph on
shift key
\emph default
 and then click and hold down the left mouse button on an empty part of
 the screen.
 With the 
\emph on
shift
\emph default
 
\emph on
key 
\emph default
and left mouse button down, drag the mouse to draw a rectangle around the
 objects you wish the select.
 Once you let go of the left mouse button, all objects that are inside or
 intersect the rectangle will be selected.
 You can also use this procedure to unselect several objects at once.
 Just repeat the procedure but hold down the 
\emph on
ctrl key
\emph default
 instead of the 
\emph on
shift key
\emph default
.
 The other selection methods work similarly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Step 5: Transforming an object
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsubsec:mylabel5"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once an object is selected you can transform it, which means you can translate,
 rotate, or scale it.
 To apply a particular transformation, make sure one of more objects are
 selected.
 Then click on one of the transform buttons on the toolbar.
 For example, to translate an object click on the translate toolbar button
 (i.e.
 the button with the crossed arrows).
 A triad appears on the selected object(s).
 The triad is positioned at the current pivot point, which is the center
 from which the transformation is applied.
 The triad consists of three colored arms and three colored planes.
 When you move the mouse over one of the arms or planes, it becomes highlighted.
 A highlighted arm or plane can be selected and when you drag the mouse,
 you can move the object in the corresponding direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For more precise modeling you can also enter the transformation numerically
 using the 
\emph on
Transform 
\emph default
dialog which is accessible from the 
\emph on

 Note that you have a virtually unlimited undo-redo stack so you rarely
 have to worry about making mistakes.
 However, for large models the undo stack may consume a lot of memory.
 The undo stack is cleared each time you save your model.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

The geometry for this first problem is quite simple, consisting of a single
 rectangular box.
 To create a box, select the 
\emph on
Create 
\emph default
tab from the 
\emph on
Build panel 
\emph default
(Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig4"

\end_inset

).
 Click the 
\emph on
Box 
\emph default
button to create a simple rectangular box.
 If you're not quite sure which button it is, you can hover over a button
 with the mouse and a tool tip appears telling you what geometry that button
 will create.
 When you click on the 
\emph on
Box 
\emph default
button, the available creation parameters are displayed below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The position coordinates of the box can be entered directly on the create
 panel.
 Alternatively, you can click anywhere on the grid to position the new box.
 Then, enter the following parameters, 
\emph on

\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $=$

\emph default
button to create the box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This completes the geometry creation step.
 The next section of the tutorial teaches you how to add the boundary conditions.
 In this tutorial we will apply some constraints and a prescribed displacement
 to the geometry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Step 2: Setting up the boundary conditions
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsubsec:mylabel8"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tutorial requires only two simple boundary conditions.
 The left side of the box will be constrained from moving.
 A prescribed displacement will be applied to the right side of the box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To apply a boundary condition, select the 
\emph on
Physics/Add Boundary Condition
\emph default
 menu.
 A dialog box appears that allows you to select the type of boundary condition.
 Select the 
\emph on
Fixed displacement
\emph default
.
 Click 
\emph on
OK 
\emph default
to create the boundary condition.
 The boundary condition will now be visible in the 
\emph on
Model Viewer
\emph default
.
 At the bottom of the 
\emph on
Model Viewer 
\emph default
several panes are now visible that allow you to customize this boundary
 condition.
 In the 
\emph on
Properties 
\emph default
pane check the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $y,$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 degrees of freedom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we need to apply this constraint to the appropriate surface of the
 model.
 On the main toolbar, you will see that there are five selection icons.
 The first one (a green ball) is the object selection button.
 The next four allow you to select parts, faces, edges, and nodes, respectively.
 For our first boundary condition we will select the left face of our box.
 First click on the 
\emph on
Select Faces 
\emph default
icon on the toolbar (blue square).
 This will allow you to select any of the faces on the box.
 Click with the left mouse button on the left face of the box.
 It should become highlighted as shown in the figure below.
 Now notice the 
\emph on
Selection 
\emph default
pane on the bottom of the 
\emph on
Model Viewer
\emph default
.

 The initial step is not an analysis step (e.g.
 you cannot set time step settings for the initial step).
 Instead it is used to define the permanent boundary conditions, that is,
 the boundary conditions that will propagate through all analysis steps.
 This aspect will be explained in more detail in the multi-step tutorial

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To attach the deformable mesh to the rigid body we need to select which
 face we wish to attach.
 To facilitate the selection we'll first hide the second, smaller box.
 You can hide an object by locating it in the 
\emph on

 From the popup menu select 
\emph on

 You'll notice that the name of the box is now grayed out in the

 Now, with only the first box showing select the right face, that is, the
 face that is touching the second box (before you hid it).
 In order to refer to this selection later, we will name the selection using
 the 
\emph on
Edit/Name Selection 
\emph default
menu.
 You can enter a name for this selection or simply accept the default.
 The selection will now show up under the

 Note that you can also name selections of parts, edges, and points.
 Named selections are convenient ways to refer to parts of your model easily.

degrees of freedom.
 (See tutorial 1 for details on how to do this.) Next, we will attach the
 named selection that we created in the previous section to a rigid body.
 Before we can do that we need to add a rigid body to our model.
 Open the 
\emph on
Material Browser
\emph default
 using the 
\emph on

\emph default
menu, select the 
\emph on
rigid body 
\emph default
from the list (under the Other category) and click the 
\emph on
Add 
\emph default
button.
 The creation of a rigid material also implicitly creates a rigid body.
 An icon will show up in the Graphics View to indicate where the rigid body
 is located in space.
 Note that the rigid body does not have any geometry yet, but we'll deal
 with that later.
 The rigid body is initially placed at the origin.
 The location of the rigid body also defines its center of rotation.
 We would like to place this center of rotation in the center of the second
 box.
 To do this, select the rigid body material in the Model Viewer.
 In the properties list below the Model Viewer set the 
\emph on
center of mass
\emph default
 parameter to 
\emph on
2.5,0,0.5
\emph default
.
 This places the rigid body in the correct spot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we'll create a rigid interface that connects a deformable body to
 a rigid body.
 Select the 
\emph on
Physics/Add Contact 
\emph default
menu and select 
\emph on
rigid 
\emph default
from the dialog box that appears.
 Click the OK button.
 A rigid interface only requires one parameter, namely the rigid body material.
 Select the rigid body you created earlier from the drop down list in the
 properties list.
 We still need to define to which part of the deformable box this rigid
 interface will be applied.
 Find the surface you defined earlier in the named selection item of the
 Model Viewer.
 Select it in the Model Viewer and click on the Select tool button at the
 top of the Model Viewer to select the surface in the Graphics View.
 With the surface now selected, select the rigid interface in the Model
 Viewer.
 In the selection box click on the `
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

' sign to assign the currently selected surface to the rigid interface.
 That's it! Your deformable mesh is now connected to the rigid body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that it was not necessary to create a named selection.
 You could have selected the surface directly and assigned it to the rigid
 interface.
 However, it is often convenient to identify selections by name so they
 can be retrieved more easily later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our rigid body is initially unconstrained.
 To prevent it from flying of in space we'll have to constrain it.
 Go to the

 In the dialog box that shows up select the rigid material and select the
 
\emph on

 After you click OK, the constraints is selected in the Model Viewer.
 In the properties list check the all the boxes except the

 We will apply a different constraint to the

It is also of some importance to point out that the rigid interface allows
 you to connect a rigid body to a non-conforming deformable mesh.
 This means that the nodes of the rigid body do not necessarily coincide
 with the nodes of the deformable mesh.
 This is convenient since this allows you to mesh the two objects separately
 without being concerned about continuity at the interface.

\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we'll set up the plane strain boundary condition.
 This boundary condition implies that no nodes can move out of the plane.
 We can enforce this by selecting the front and back face of the box and
 constraining it in the z-direction.
 To select the faces, first select the 
\emph on
Select Faces 
\emph default
button 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename Figures/selectSurface.png
	width 0.17in
	height 0.17in

\end_inset

 on the main toolbar.
 Next, select both the top (
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

z) and bottom (-z) faces of the mesh.
 Then, apply a fixed constraint by selecting the 
\emph on
Physics/Add Boundary Condition 
\emph default
and selecting 
\emph on
Fixed constraint 
\emph default
from the list.
 In the properties list, check the 
\emph on
z-displacement 
\emph default
degree of freedom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we need to set up the symmetry boundary conditions.
 Basically, we need to constrain the back face (
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

y) and the left face (-x) so that the nodes on these faces can only move
 in the respective planes and not normal to the planes.
 Starting with the left face, select it and apply a fixed constraint to
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

degree of freedom of this face.
 Deselect the selected face by pressing the ESC button or by clicking somewhere
 outside your mesh.
 Now, select the back face (
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

y) and constrain it in the y-direction.
 Finally, we will also constrain the front face (-y) so that it can only
 move in the y-direction.
 Select the face and apply a fixed constraint on the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

degree of freedom (the z-degree of freedom was already as a result of the
 first boundary condition).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we will create the contact interface.
 Go to the

 Select 
\emph on

\emph default
 and click on the 
\emph on

 The rigid wall interface creates a contact interface between your mesh
 and a rigid wall.
 The rigid wall is an implicitly defined surface so it does not need to
 be modeled and we do not need to specify any geometry for it.
 Instead it is described using the plane equation.

This places the rigid wall at the bottom of the mesh, moving upwards.
 The rigid wall will now be visible in the Graphics View.

\begin_layout Standard
In this tutorial we model the unconfined compression of a porous biphasic
 material.
 The geometry consists of a cylinder to which a prescribed displacement
 is applied in the axial direction.
 After loading the sample, the displacement is held constant while the material
 relaxes in the radial direction due to the interstitial fluid flow through
 the material boundaries.

\begin_layout Standard
Create a cylinder with a radius of 1 and a height of 1.
 To reduce the computational time, we will again create a quarter symmetry
 problem and setup proper symmetric boundary conditions.
 This implies that we first need to create the mesh.
 (Remember to use the

 degree of freedom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, select the xz-plane of the cylinder and apply a fixed constraint to
 constrain the 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

degree of freedom.
 Also, apply a fixed constraint to the bottom plane (xy-plane) in the z
 direction.
 Finally we add one more fixed constraint, namely on the outer curved surface
 of the cylinder for which we constrain the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 fluid pressure) degree of freedom.
 Select the 
\emph on
Physics/Add Boundary Condition
\emph default
 menu, and then select the

 in the dialog box that shows up.
 Press OK and the boundary condition will show up in the Model Viewer.
 Make sure to check the checkbox for 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 in the properties list.
 The reason that we constrain the pressure degree of freedom is because
 we want to make this a free-draining surface.
 The fluid is allowed to leave through a free-draining surface.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To define the kinematics of the problem, apply a prescribed displacement
 to the top plane in the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$

 direction.
 Leave the scale factor set to 
\emph on

\emph default
 since we will define the displacement through a curve.
 Open the Curve Editor (
\emph on

\emph default
menu) and locate the curve of the prescribed constraint.
 Select the first point of the curve and move it to the coordinates (0,
 -0.01).
 It's easier to type these numbers in the edit field below the curve than
 to move the node manually.
 Move the other node to (2000, -0.01).
 This point will lay off the current plot area.

\begin_layout Standard
Before we apply boundary conditions, we need to take a closer look at the
 
\emph on
Model Viewer 
\emph default
and in particular at the 
\emph on
Steps 
\emph default
item.
 You'll see that FEBioStudio by default creates a single step, named the
 
\emph on
Initial 
\emph default
step.
 The initial step serves a special purpose since it collects all the constraints
, such as boundary conditions, loads, contact interfaces, etc.
 that do not depend on a particular step.
 In other words, all the constraints that are defined for this step will
 be applied during the initialization phase of the analysis and will remain
 active throughout all the steps.
 This is different from constraints defined in an analysis step, since those
 constraints will only remain active during that particular step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we will apply a load only during the static phase, we first create
 a step to model this phase.
 Add a 
\emph on
Structural Mechanics 
\emph default
analysis step as was done before in the previous tutorials by either selecting
 the 
\emph on
Physics/Add Step 
\emph default
menu or by right-clicking on the 
\emph on

\emph default
item in the Model Viewer.
 In the 
\emph on

\emph default
properties set the 
\emph on

\emph default

\emph on

\emph default

 Uncheck the 
\emph on

\emph default
 option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, create another 
\emph on
Structural Mechanics 
\emph default
step in a similar way.
 In the time settings set the 
\emph on
time steps 
\emph default
to 40 and the 
\emph on
time step size 
\emph default
to 1.0.
 This step will be a dynamic analysis so change the 
\emph on

\emph default
in the 
\emph on

\emph default
settings to dynamic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize, we now have three steps defined: the initial step where we
 will place all persistent boundary conditions that remain active during
 the entire analysis, a first quasi-static analysis step during which we
 will apply the load, and finally a dynamic analysis step to simulate the
 free vibration response of the beam.

 This is often more convenient then applying a nodal load on a surface since
 in the latter case the total effective force will depend on the number
 of nodes on that surface.
 The traction load remains independent of the mesh.

This tutorial examines the indentation of a biphasic layer with a rigid
 impermeable frictionless indenter under creep loading.
 The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate the 3D modeling of axisymmetric
 problems using wedge geometries and a plane of symmetry not aligned with
 the coordinate planes (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig28"

\end_inset

).
 The tutorial also shows how to create biased meshes, and attaching and
 welding congruent meshes.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since FEBio does not provide 2D axisymmetric elements, an axisymmetric analysis
 may be simulated in 3D using only a wedge (slice) out of the true 3D geometry.
 Reducing the wedge angle increases the faithfulness of the 3D analysis
 to the 2D axisymmetric analysis.
 In this tutorial we will use a wedge angle of 3 degrees.
 The first objective is to create the wedge representing the biphasic layer
 and mesh it as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig29"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the mesh is biased along the radial and axial directions.
 The axial direction has a dual bias (the mesh is finer at both ends and
 coarser in the middle).
 This type of biasing is a standard feature that can be implemented by simply
 checking a box and entering a bias value as shown below.
 The radial direction also shows a dual bias, but the location of the dividing
 line is not at the midpoint of the radial extent.
 To reproduce this non-standard bias, two geometries must be created, meshed
 congruently, then attached and welded.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FEBioStudio supports different mesh and surface file formats, including
 ABAQUS, NIKE3D, ANSYS, STL, BYU, and many more.
 (See Appendix A for a detailed list of supported formats.) Since FEBioStudio
 doesn't have a lot of mesh generation capabilities, users often create
 their finite element mesh in another software package and then import it
 into FEBioStudio.
 From here, boundary conditions and material properties are defined.
 Although many of the techniques from previous tutorials can be applied
 directly to imported meshes, some important differences exist between PreView's
 primitives and imported meshes.
 This tutorial will walk the reader through importing a mesh and setting
 up a simple finite element analysis on the imported mesh.

 This opens a standard file open dialog box.
 In the file filter list, locate the filter that corresponds to the file
 format you want to open.
 In this tutorial we'll use an Abaqus (.inp) file, so select the corresponding
 filter.
 Then locate the 
\emph on
box.inp
\emph default
 file and press the Open button.
 A second dialog box will now open where some options can be set for reading
 Abaqus files.
 For our problem the default settings are sufficient so just click OK.
 FEBioStudio will now read the file and show it in the Graphics View.
 In the Model Viewer you will also see that FEBioStudio added an item in
 the Geometry list with the same name as the imported file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When FEBioStudio reads a mesh, it creates a geometry object for that mesh.
 It does this by automatically partitioning the mesh and its surface.
 The surface is partitioned using an algorithm that detects the crease edges
 in the mesh using an angle criterion.
 In our case, the default partitioning is sufficient, but the reader can
 consult Chapter 4 for more details on the auto-partitioning algorithm in
 FEBioStudio and on how to customize the partitioning in case the default
 partitioning is not the desired partitioning.

Next, we will setup the boundary conditions.

) there are two ways for setting up boundary conditions.
 You can assign boundary conditions and apply loads to the surfaces, edges
 and nodes of the geometry.
 Alternatively, you can apply them directly to the mesh' face or nodes.
 Since both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, we will discuss
 both approaches.

In this step we will apply the boundary conditions directly to the items
 of the mesh.
 It will be easier to apply boundary conditions when the mesh is visible
 so turn on the mesh (if it's not on yet) by pressing the '
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

' shortcut key.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Make sure the object is selected.
 Notice that for an editable mesh several more options appear on the toolbar
 at the bottom of the Graphics View.
 These options allow you to make mesh item selections.
 Click on the 
\emph on

 Notice that bounding box of the selected object turns yellow.
 This is to indicate that you are selecting mesh items.
 Select the bottom faces of the box.
 If the 
\emph on

\emph default
button is checked you only need to select one facet of the bottom surface.
 FEBioStudio will automatically select all faces that are connected to this
 face.
 After all faces of the bottom surface are selected, apply a fixed boundary

\begin_layout Standard
This section describes an alternative method for applying boundary conditions
 for imported meshes.
 As mentioned earlier, when FEBioStudio imports a mesh it also generates
 a geometry object and partitions it based on angle-criteria.
 Working with the geometry is often more convenient, however sometimes it
 may be necessary to modify the partitioning of the object.
 In this case, we want to apply a load to the center vertex of the top surface.
 However, FEBioStudio did not create a geometry node for this vertex.
 You can see this by activating the (geometry) node selection option on
 the main toolbar.
 FEBioStudio will draw all the geometry nodes (in blue) and you will see
 that there is no node in the center of the top surface.
 We will begin by adding this center vertex to the geometry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Make sure the object is selected and the object selection is active (green
 ball) on the main toolbar.
 On the Graphics View toolbar turn of the 
\emph on
Select connected 
\emph default
option and select the center vertex of the top surface.
 Activate the Mesh panel and find the 
\emph on
Partition
\emph default
 tool.
 This tool doesn't have any parameters so just press the 
\emph on
Apply 
\emph default
button.
 If you now activate the (geometry) node selection option on the main toolbar,
 you will see that the center vertex is now also a geometry node.
 With the partitioning completed, we can now go on to applying boundary
 conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
\emph on
Important Note:

Modifying the partitioning of an object can change the numbering of surfaces,
 edges, and nodes.
 It is therefore important to always adjust the partitioning before applying
 any boundary conditions.
 Modifying the partitioning after applying boundary conditions may invalidate
 the boundary conditions and cause problems when exporting the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you already applied the boundary conditions via method 1, you will first
 need to delete these boundary conditions.
 You can do this by selecting them in the Model Viewer and selecting the

In this model we use a Newtonian fluid.
 Since the fluid domain may expand as the fluid pressurizes, we use a fluid-FSI
 material which includes a solid component to account for the mesh deformation
 of the fluid domain.
 The solid component should have zero density and a very low stiffness;
 in principle you can choose any of the available elastic materials in FEBio,
 however the material that works best for FSI analyses is the neo-Hookean
 material model with its Poisson ratio set to zero.
 To add a material to the model, open the

Step 3: Setting up the boundary conditions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To impose a no-slip condition at the interface between the viscous fluid
 and the elastic wall, select that interface and apply a zero fluid velocity
 boundary condition in the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $y,$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 degrees of freedom.
 In actuality we are fixing the relative velocity between the fluid and
 wall, since the elastic wall may also deform.
 This can be done by selecting 
\emph on
Physics 
\emph default
from the menu and then selecting 
\emph on
Add Boundary Condition
\emph default
.
 Alternatively, on the model tree you can right-click 
\emph on
Boundary Condition
\emph default
 and select 
\emph on
Add Boundary Condition
\emph default
.
 Or another way to bring up the boundary condition menu is to select hotkey
 Ctrl-B (Cmd-B on Mac).
 Now, in the add BC menu, select 
\emph on
zero fluid velocity 
\emph default
and press 
\emph on
OK.
 
\emph default
The boundary condition should appear in the model viewer.
 Under 
\emph on
Properties
\emph default
 click the check boxes for x, y, and z fluid velocity since we want to fix
 them.
 Now, making sure that the 
\emph on
Select Surfaces
\emph default
 button is clicked, select the interface between the fluid and elastic solid
 domains, which will likely require you to click twice since the first click
 will select the outer solid wall surface; then click the plus-sign in the
 BC selection box, so that this BC can be assigned to the selected surface
 (Figure

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we need to suitably fix the displacement of the solid domains.
 Go back to 
\emph on
Add Boundary Condition
\emph default
 and select 
\emph on
Fixed Displacement.

\emph default
 Make sure the surface previously highlighted is deselected by clicking
 anywhere outside the model in the graphics viewer.
 In the model viewer, under 
\emph on
Properties
\emph default
, check the box for 
\emph on
z-displacement 
\emph default
as we are assigning a symmetry boundary condition to the ends of the cylinder.
 Assign this boundary condition to the end faces of the solid elastic wall
 and the fluid-FSI domains, for a total of four surfaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we will be prescribing a parabolic fluid velocity profile at the inlet
 face of the fluid domain, FEBio can produce more stable numerical convergence
 if we prescribe or fix the fluid dilatation on the circular edge of that
 inlet face (the face whose outward normal is along the negative 
\begin_inset Formula $z-$
\end_inset

direction).
 Make sure that 
\emph on
Select Curves 
\emph default
is selected and assign a 
\emph on
zero fluid dilatation
\emph default
 BC to that circular edge.
 This boundary condition is needed since the dilatation on the inlet curve
 would otherwise be indeterminate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we have to prescribe the surface loads.
 This time, select 
\emph on
Physics 
\emph default
from the menu and then select 
\emph on
Add Surface Load
\emph default
.
 Alternatively, on the model tree you can right click 
\emph on
Loads
\emph default
 and select 
\emph on
Add Surface Load
\emph default
.
 Or another way to bring up the boundary condition menu is to select hotkey
 Ctrl-L (Cmd-L on Mac).
 Now, from the 
\emph on
Add Surface Load
\emph default
 menu, click on the option 
\emph on
fluid normal velocity
\emph default
 and press 
\emph on
OK
\emph default
.
 The surface load should show up in the model viewer.
 Under 
\emph on
Properties
\emph default
, we want to set the 
\emph on
velocity=-1
\emph default
 as the fluid is to flow into the cylinder (opposite to the outer surface
 normal).
 The 
\emph on
parabolic
\emph default
 option should be checked.
 Then keeping all the other parameters at their default value, assign this
 boundary load to the fluid inlet surface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we want to prescribe outlet boundary conditions.
 Going back to 
\emph on
Add Surface Load
\emph default
, now select 
\emph on
Fluid Flow Resistance
\emph default
.
 Under 
\emph on
Properties
\emph default
, let us set 
\emph on
resistance=1000 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
pressure_offset=100
\emph default
.
 Assign this boundary load to the fluid outlet surface, which is the cylinder
 end face not on the origin.
 Note that for both the inlet prescribed velocity and outlet resistance
 and pressure, a load curve can be assigned that controls the magnitudes
 of these boundary conditions over time if so desired.
 The 
\emph on
Curve Editor
\emph default
 can be accessed from either selecting 
\emph on
Tools 
\emph default
and then 
\emph on
Curve Editor
\emph default
 from the menu or by clicking the 
\emph on
Curve Editor 
\emph default
button from the toolbar.
 However, for this tutorial, the default load curves will be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, we need to make sure the fluid pressure is felt by the elastic wall.
 Going again to 
\emph on
Add Surface Load
\emph default
, now select 
\emph on
FSI Interface Traction.

\emph default
 Assign this boundary load on the interface side wall between the fluid
 and solid domains.
 Again, like before the surface may have to be clicked twice such that this
 inner surface is correctly selected (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig42"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 No parameters are needed for this boundary load.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Step 4: Setting up the analysis step
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, an analysis step needs to be defined.
 Select the 
\emph on
Physics/Add Analysis Step
\emph default
 menu.
 Select 
\emph on
Fluid-FSI Mechanics
\emph default
.
 Click OK to add the step to the model.
 Then change the following parameters under the Model Viewer while keeping

\begin_layout Standard
The Graphics View shows a 3D view of the current model.
 The user can adjust the view in several ways.
 The fastest way of maneuvering through the view is by using the mouse.
 The different mouse buttons invoke different commands depending on the
 current 
\emph on
mode 
\emph default
of the Graphics View.
 There are four buttons on the Toolbar that control this mode, namely the
 
\emph on
select
\emph default
, 
\emph on
move
\emph default
, 
\emph on
rotate 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
scale 
\emph default
buttons.
 The current mode is indicated by the button that is highlighted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of the Graphics view mode, the view can be rotated by dragging
 the mouse button outside any geometry while holding down the left mouse
 button.
 A similar action but with the right mouse button down allows the user to
 zoom the view.
 The user can pan the current view by holding down the middle mouse button.
 Objects and items can be selected in all four Graphics view modes.
 To select an object or item (e.g.
 part, surface, edge), bring the mouse cursor over the object or item, and
 click on it with the left mouse button.
 To add objects or items to the current selection, hold down the shift button
 while clicking on the object or item.
 To add several objects or items, drag the mouse while holding down the
 shift button and left mouse button.
 To deselect objects or items, the same operations can be performed, only
 this time, hold down the ctrl button instead of the shift button.
 To deselect all objects or items at once, click in an empty area of the
 Graphics View.
 There are also several menu items that allow you to modify the current
 selection.

When the Graphics View is in one of three transform modes (move, rotate
 or scale) a triad will appear in the center of the selection.
 When moving the mouse over the triad, one of its arms may highlight, indicating
 that this arm can be selected.
 To apply a transformation to the current selection, bring the mouse cursor
 over one of the triad arms so that it highlights.
 Next, drag the mouse button while holding down the left mouse button.
 Releasing the left mouse button will let go of the arm and finish the transform
ation.

 It can also be accessed using the

 The

Curve Editor 
\emph default
gives an overview of all the time-dependent parameters in the model.
 FEBioStudio allows the user to define the time dependency explicitly through
 the use of so-called 
\emph on
load curves
\emph default
.
 A load curve is simply an interpolated function of (time, value) pairs.
 The value will have a meaning that depends on the parameter associated
 with the curve.
 For example, if the load curve describes a nodal displacement, the value
 of the curve is the actual displacement and has the length units used in
 the design of the geometry.
 If the load curve describes a material parameter, then the value is the
 time evolution of that parameter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that many features that allow you to define a load
 curve also allow you to define a scale factor.
 In that case, the actual value of the parameter is the scale factor multiplied
 with the load curve value.
 For example, when prescribing the displacement, the scale factor is defined
 in the properties dialog when creating the prescribed constraint.
 The scale factor is not taken into account in the Curve Editor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the top of the curve editor's overview panel, the selection filter can
 be found.
 This filter allows you to show the load curves of only a specific type
 of model component, e.g.
 boundary conditions, material parameters, etc.
 This filter can be helpful in finding a specific parameter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most load curves have a default linear shape that ramps up the value from
 zero to one.
 However, all curves can be modified using the tools available at the bottom
 of the Curve Editor.
 The curve's data points are represented as dots on the view.
 These data points can be selected by clicking on them with the left mouse
 button.
 They can also be moved by click
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

dragging them.
 The current (time, value) pair of the selected point is displayed on the
 toolbar at the bottom of the view.
 This toolbar offers the following features.

 FEBioStudio can import several different mesh file formats.
 Geometry can be imported using the 
\emph on

\emph default
menu.
 Appendix A lists an overview of all the supported file formats including
 the supported features of the particular formats.
\end_layout

, one of the panels on the Build panel, gives access to the object's creation
 parameters and editing options.
 For primitives this shows the same parameters as when the object was created.
 This allows you to change the object's dimensions at any time.
 If the object is not a primitive, no options will be shown here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other feature to note at the top of both the Edit and Mesh panels is
 the Object rollout.
 This shows the name of the active object as well as its type.
 An object can be converted to a different type via the

 As noted before, FEBioStudio was not designed to be a powerful mesh generator,
 but regardless, has some simple mesh creating and editing features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Meshing Primitives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the object is a primitive, that is, created with one of the geometry
 creation tools, the command window will list the mesh creation parameters
 for that particular object.
 Most primitives will be meshed with a so-called 
\emph on
butterfly mesh
\emph default
.
 These primitives have a simple rectangular box as center.
 The rest of the mesh is a projection from this box to the respective geometry.
 For instance, for the sphere the surface of the inner box is projected
 onto a sphere.
 This projection is segmented to create several layers of elements.
 Note that all solid primitives are composed of 8-noded hexahedral elements
 and all shell primitives are composed of 4-noded quadrilateral elements.
 After you changed the mesh parameters simply press the 
\emph on
Apply 
\emph default
button to create the new mesh.
 To show the mesh in the Graphics View select the 
\emph on
View/Toggle Mesh lines
\emph default
 menu or use the '
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

' shortcut.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Editable Surfaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An 
\emph on
editable surface
\emph default
 is an object that is defined via a surface mesh.
 The surface mesh can be edited via the tools on the Edit panel.
 If the mesh is closed and composed of triangles, the object can be meshed
 using the Tetgen tool, available from the Mesh panel.
 This tool will generate a tetrahedral mesh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The surface of an editable surface can be modified via the tools on the
 
\emph on
Edit 
\emph default
panel:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Project curve: 
\series default
projects a curve on the mesh and modifies the mesh locally so that the curve
 becomes a crease edge of the mesh.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Partition: 
\series default
Partition the mesh selection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Smooth: 
\series default
Smooths the surface mesh.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Edge collapse: 
\series default
Collapses small edges.
 This tool can improve the quality of the mesh.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Decimate: 
\series default
Remesh the triangular meshes using a Centroidal Voronoi Diagram based approach.
 Decimation is the process of decreasing the number of triangles in the
 mesh.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Scale
\emph default
: This option helps in creating a uniform triangular mesh.
 Scale value specifies the desired reduction in the total number of nodes
 in the final decimated mesh.

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Remove duplicate elements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Remove non-manifold elements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fix winding: This option works only for triangular mesh.
 This option checks if the nodes of the triangle are in same sequence clockwise/
anti-clockwise direction for all the triangular shells.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fill all holes: Finds and fills the holes in the triangular mesh by adding
 new triangular faces.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsection
Editable Meshes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the object is a so-called 
\emph on
editable mesh 
\emph default
the Mesh panel will list some mesh editing tools.
 Editable meshes don't have a geometry object associated with it so the
 mesh, or at least its surface, defines the geometry implicitly.
 This has some important consequences related to applying boundary conditions
 to an editable mesh.
 Any change to the mesh may also change the corresponding geometry and as
 a consequence any data that was associated with the previous geometry may
 become invalid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Important Note.

\series default
 
\emph on
It is best to first make the necessary modifications to an editable mesh
 before you apply any boundary conditions or loads.
 Any modifications to an editable mesh may invalidate boundary conditions
 and loads.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Editable meshes can be edited on several levels, namely the 
\emph on
object level
\emph default
, the 
\emph on
element level
\emph default
, the 
\emph on
face level, 
\emph default
the
\emph on
 edge level, 
\emph default
and the 
\emph on
node level
\emph default
.
 The element, face, edge, and node level are also referred to as the sub-object
 levels.
 When an object is an 
\emph on
editable mesh 
\emph default
(or editable surface), the Graphics control bar, will show additional buttons
 that allow you to select mesh items.

 Next, a drop-down list displays all the steps for which you can define

 If you choose the 
\emph on

 step, the step will be applied in the initialization phase of the analysis
 and will remain active for all subsequent analysis steps.
 If you choose any other step, the boundary condition will only remain active
 during that step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After you selected the step and the type of boundary condition, simply press
 OK to add the boundary condition to the model and edit the parameters in
 the Model Viewer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, there are two types of boundary conditions.
 There are the 
\emph on
fixed constraints 
\emph default
and the 
\emph on
prescribed constraints
\emph default
.
 For a fixed constraint, the corresponding degree of freedom is kept zero
 throughout the entire analysis.
 For a prescribed constraint, the value of the corresponding degree of freedom
 is defined through a load curve.
 You may wonder why the fixed constraints are available, since you can achieve
 the same result by defining a zero load curve for a prescribed constraint.
 The reason is that the degrees of freedom for fixed constraints are removed
 from the linear system of equations, reducing the computational time to
 solve the linear system.
 On the other hand, since the equations are removed, no reaction loads are
 calculated for fixed constraints.
 If you need to know for instance the reaction force on a boundary, you
 need to use a prescribed displacement even if the displacement is zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to understand that with each prescribed constraint a load
 curve is associated.
 The actual value for the constraint at any given time is the product of
 the scale factor which you will enter in the properties dialog for the
 boundary condition and the value of the load curve at that time.
 Since by default the load curve will ramp from zero to one, the constraint
 value will ramp from zero to the specified value in a linear way.
 If you wish to modify the default curve you can edit it in the Curve Editor.

Fixed Shell Displacement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Certain shell element formulations used in FEBio have two sets of displacement
 degrees of freedom.
 One for the front-face of the shell, and one for the back face.
 The usual displacement degrees of freedom are used for the front-face of
 the shell, and the shell displacement degrees of freedom are used for the
 back-face of the shell.
 This boundary condition allows you to fix the back-face shell degrees of
 freedom.

\begin_layout Standard
The degrees of freedom of rigid bodies can be constrained in the same way
 as any other degree of freedom in the model.
 Before you can apply a constraint to a rigid body, you need to define a
 rigid body.
 In FEBioStudio, rigid bodies are implicitly defined when you create a rigid
 body material.
 A rigid body constraint can now be applied using the 
\emph on
Physics/Add Rigid Constraint 
\emph default
menu.
 It is important to note that when a rigid body is created none of its degrees
 of freedom are initially constrained.

In FEBio, contact constraints are enforced using an

approach.
 This implies that the Lagrange multipliers are only approximated to a user-spec
ified tolerance.
 The following parameters will appear in nearly all contact interfaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
augmented Lagrangian
\series default
: Turn the augmented Lagrangian method on or off.
 When off, a penalty method is used for constraint enforcement.

\series default
: Set the convergence tolerance for the Lagrange multipliers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Penalty factor: 
\series default
The penalty factor controls the rate of convergence.
 A high penalty factor will try to reach the tolerance quickly, but if chosen
 too high might introduce instability into the system.
 If it is too low, convergence to within the specified tolerance might not
 be reached.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For sliding interfaces, there will usually be an option for 
\emph on
two-pass
\emph default
 option.
 In a usual contact implementation, the required integrations are only performed
 over one of the surfaces, usually referred to as the 
\emph on
slave 
\emph default
surface.
 If the contacting surfaces are perfectly smooth, it does not matter which
 surface acts as the slave or master surface.
 However, in an FE simulation the surfaces are discretized and are most
 likely non-conforming.
 Thus, the choice of master and slave surfaces is important and will introduce
 bias in the solution.
 It is usually advisable to select the more finely meshed surface as the
 slave.
 In the 
\emph on
two pass algorithm
\emph default
, an attempt is made to reduce the bias by performing the contact calculations
 twice, with the roles of slave and master surface switched for the second
 pass.
 Although it may appear that the two pass algorithm is always the best choice,
 this is not always so.
 Certain contact applications perform better using a single pass.
 See the 
\emph on
FEBio Theory Manual 
\emph default
for a more detailed description of the contact model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the contact parameters are entered the user needs to define the 
\emph on
master 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
slave 
\emph default
surfaces.
 To do this, first close the contact interface dialog and select the contact
 interface in the Model Editor.
 In the Model Editor you will now notice two selection boxes, one for the
 master surface and one for the slave surface.
 The boxes work similarly as for boundary conditions.
 For instance, to add a surface of your model to the master surface, select
 the surface in the Graphics View and press the '
\begin_inset Formula $+$
\end_inset

' button in the master's surface selection box.

There are two ways to make a deformable object interact with a rigid body,
 namely via a Rigid interface, or via a Rigid wall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 are used to connect a part of the deformable mesh to a non-conforming rigid

 By 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we mean that the nodes comprising the mesh of the deformable object do
 not mate directly to the nodes comprising the rigid body at the interface.
 In other words, no nodes are shared between the two objects.
 The rigid interface requires only one parameter: the rigid material that
 defines the rigid body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
A rigid wall
\series default
 interface is similar to a sliding interface except that the master surface
 is a rigid plane.
 The geometry of the plane is simplified since the master surface is implicitly
 defined by the plane equation of the wall and does not need to be modeled
 explicitly.
 The plane can also be assigned a prescribed displacement in the Curve Editor.
 Just look for the name of the rigid wall and edit the 
\emph on

\emph default
curve.
 In this case the plane equation generalizes to:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A sliding interface defines a non-penetration constraint between two surfaces.
 This means that the surfaces are allowed to separate and slide across each
 other, but are not allowed to penetrate each other.
 If the contacting parts are biphasic or multiphasic, specialized contact
 interfaces can be used to allow fluid or solvent to flow across the contact
 interface when the parts are in contact.
 The following sliding interfaces are available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 This initial step does not perform an actual analysis; instead it is a
 placeholder for the initialization phase of the analysis.
 Currently, the most important aspect of this step is that all boundary
 conditions, loads, constraints, etc.
 that are defined in this step will remain active during all subsequent
 analysis steps.
 This is different from an analysis step in that e.g.
 a boundary condition defined in an analysis step will only remain active
 during that step.
